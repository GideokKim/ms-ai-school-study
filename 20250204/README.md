The plot shows: <br> • 3D quadratic surface <br> • Red tangent plane at point (-7, 0) <br> • Interactive 3D rotation capability |

## 🛠️ Setup and Requirements

To run these notebooks, you'll need:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

For the best experience, we recommend using:
- Python 3.8+
- VSCode with Jupyter extension
- Dark theme for optimal visualization

## 📁 Directory Structure

```bash

├── 3d_surface_tangent.ipynb
└── README.md
```

## 🎨 Style Guide
All visualizations follow these principles:
- Dark theme for better contrast
- Clear axis labels and titles
- Interactive when possible
- Consistent color schemes

## 🤝 Contributing
Feel free to add your own mathematical visualizations! Please follow these steps:
1. Create a new Jupyter notebook with a descriptive name
2. Add a screenshot of your visualization to the `images/` directory
3. Update this README with your visualization in the gallery
4. Ensure your code is well-documented and follows the style guide

## 📝 Note
To make the gallery work properly, you'll need to:
1. Create an `images` directory
2. Save a screenshot of each visualization
3. Update the image paths in this README
